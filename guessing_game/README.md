# Guessing Game: Chapter 2

This is a guessing game written in the rust programming language, it is the first non-trivial program that I have written in the language. 

## Setup

To run this program, you must have rust installed. To install rust, you can clone the repository or use a package manager like choco (if on windows) or brew (if on macos) or apt (if on ubuntu linux). 

Once you have rust installed. Run this command in your bash terminal or your cmd/powershell:
```s
cargo run
```
The program should begin. If you run into issues try running:
```s
cargo install
```
first before the previous command.

You can quit the program in your terminal by pressing control/command + c.
